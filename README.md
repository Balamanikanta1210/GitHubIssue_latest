#Adobe RPA Template
The framework is meant to be a template that helps the user design processes that offer, at a barebones minimum, a way to store, read, and easily modify project configuration data, a robust exception handling scheme and event logging for all exceptions and relevant transaction information.Because logs generated by each process are a vital component of its report generation, the framework logs messages at each relevant step toward solving a business transaction and sends those logs to the Orchestrator server. When we build tools, we try to first define their purpose and, in this scenario, the purpose of our framework is to solve a collection of business transactions.
